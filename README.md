# Dynamics defined by k-canalizing functions

The repository contains the code of an ongoing project that aims at understanding how the dynamics of a discrete dynamical system defined by boolean functions of some canalizing depth depends on the depth.

## Structure

  - **core/**  Folder with main functions for working with k-canalizing functions and discrete dynamical systems
  - **sampling/** Code for massive sampling random discrete dynamical systems with some requirements on canalizing depth
  - **data/** Data generated by this sampling process
  - **data_analysis/** Code for analysing and visualising the data
  - **tests/** Tests
